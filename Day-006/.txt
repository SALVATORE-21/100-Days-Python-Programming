Functions - A name followed by a paranthesis [And the content inside will get outputted]
=================================================================================================
print()
len()

Making our own Function -
def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")

def my_function():
    #Do this
    #Then do this
    #Finally do this

After defining a function we need to call the function to execute it
my_function()

=================================================================================================
Indentation - Professional spacing to understand the code or pattern of writing it
=================================================================================================
def my_function():
    print("Hi")  - The space before the line is called as Indentatio

if sky == "BLUE":
    print("Good to go out")
elif sky == "DARK":
    print("May be rainy")

Here the spaces before the conditions make them categorize to get executed.
4 spaces to gether is a tab space - intendation
==================================================================================================
While LOOP
==================================================================================================
while something_is_true:
    #Do something repeatedly

a = 6
while a>0 :
    print("HELLO WORLD")
    a -= 1
    print(a)

----------
The comparision between for and while loop is when u wann track every number we need a for where to skip the step to step excution
but to run until the condition is met while can be used
